The objective of *RaspiMote* is to allow almost anyone to turn its Raspberry Pi into a programmable keyboard / controller / remote control...
With custom physical input methods **and** custom software features with the provided driver. The driver will only work on Windows and Linux at first, but macOS compatibility may be added later.

To that end, we recommend to use a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/), or a [Raspberry Pi Zero WH](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3708). This project can work on a [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/), but it would not be possible to natively run *RaspiMote* wirelessly (as the Pi Zero is not Wi-Fi-capable): you would need a [Micro-B USB to RJ45 adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RM3KXAU) or a [USB Wi-Fi dongle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008IFXQFU/), along with an [OTG adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LN3LQKQ/).

**For now, the project IS NOT ready, but it's under active development.**
