    <h1>Description NEED CSS</h1>
    <p>You want to turn your Raspberry Pi into a programmable keyboard / controller / remote control? RaspiMote is what you need! In this documentation, you will learn to install RaspiMote on your Raspberry Pi (we recommend to use a Raspberry Pi Zero W / WH) and the driver to configure and use it on your computer running Windows or Linux.


The objective of RaspiMote is to allow almost anyone to turn its Raspberry Pi into a programmable keyboard / controller / remote control... With custom physical input methods and custom software features with the provided driver. To that end, we recommend to use a Raspberry Pi Zero W, or a Raspberry Pi Zero WH. This project can work on a Raspberry Pi Zero, but it would not be possible to natively run RaspiMote wirelessly (as the Pi Zero is not Wi-Fi-capable): you would need a Micro-B USB to RJ45 adapter or a USB Wi-Fi dongle, along with an OTG adapter.

We are not in any kind of relationship with the “Raspberry Pi Foundation”. This software is provided by independent developers.
For now, the project IS NOT ready, but it's under active development.
This project is co-developed by @Firmin-Launay and @A-delta.

The program is divided into two main sections, one running on the Raspberry Pi, and the other acting as a driver on the computer. The Pi gathers the inputs and sends it to the driver over one of the two connection modes available for the moment.

    <h1>Getting Started</h1>

    <h2>How to install</h2>
    <p>To install RaspiMote on your hardware, transfer the <code>pi</code> folder to your Raspberry Pi and the <code>driver</code> folder to your computer, then you can run the provided scripts :</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>win_install.cmd</code> / <code>win_install.ps1</code> for Windows</li>
        <li><code>lnx_install.sh</code> / <code>deb_install.sh</code> for (Debian-based) Linux distributions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Basic setup</h2>
    <p>The main purpose of RaspiMote is to allow you to create your own functions that will fit your needs, (for provided functions, see Built-in functions).<br>The process is divided in two parts :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Writing Pi’s code to add your inputs</li>
        <li>Writing driver’s code to connect those inputs to functions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pi</h3>
    <p>You will need to customise your RaspiMote Pi script to add your physical inputs.<br>The <code>Pi</code> class comes with some premade inputs methods :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Buttons</li>
        <li>USB Devices (keyboard, mouses)</li>
        <li>Analog Digital Converters (ADC)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When creating the Pi object, you can add a config dictionary, see the following example :</p>
    <code>
        pi = Pi([<br>
           {"pin": "21", "type_input": "button"},<br>
           {"pin": "20", "type_input": "button"},<br>
           {"pin": "16", "type_input": "button"},<br>
           {"pin": "6", "type_input": "button"},<br>
           {"pin": "13", "type_input": "button"},<br>
           {"pin": "19", "type_input": "button"},<br>
           {"pin": "26", "type_input": "button"},<br>
    ])
    </code>

    <p>This only works for buttons for the moment.<br>If you want to add USB and ADC devices, use the dedicated methods with this code (example) :</p>
    <code>
        pi.add_ADC_Device_PCF8591(2)<br>
        pi.add_USB_Device(1)<br>
        pi.add_USB_Device(4)<br>
    </code>

    <h3>Driver</h3>
    <p>After having added your input to the Raspberry Pi, you need to decide what they will do on your pc. You must customise <code>driver/lan_server/command_processor.py</code>, in parse_data() function, you can write your code. See “Built-in functions” section to see what features are available or write your own ones.</p>
    <p>Example of a USB keyboard that writes mathematical symbols :</p>

    <code>
        key_to_char = { <br>
   "KEY_Q": "α", <br>
   "KEY_W": "β", <br>
   "KEY_E": "π", <br>
   "KEY_R": "ω", <br>
   "KEY_T": "Δ", <br>
   "KEY_Y": "≈", <br>
   "KEY_U": "√", <br>
   "KEY_I": "∞", <br>
   "KEY_O": "≠", <br>
} <br>

if type_device == "USB" and pin == 4 and int(extra) == 1: <br>
   if value in key_to_char: <br>
       type_text(key_to_char[value]) <br>

    </code>


    <h2>Running</h2>
    <h3>Pi</h3>
    <p>Before the system runs, you need to execute <code>pi.establish_connection(server_IP)</code> to initiate connection with driver then <code>pi.run()</code></p>

    <h3>Driver</h3>
    <p>Simultaneously, DRIVER START BLABLA</p>

    <h2>Built-in functions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Simulate keystroke and key combinaison (any character and function key)</li>
        <li>Change sound level</li>
        <li>etc</li>
    </ul>
